Utilize tools like the Wappalyzer plugin to gain an idea. Use Crawler/Fuzzing tools to crawl/fuzz the endpoints, which will help in identifying certain endpoints. Always aim to demonstrate high impact in your report. For example, if I had only reported the credentials, I would have been paid only $250. However, by showing the impact through logging into the Adminer application, I managed to receive the full payout of $700 (based on Synack’s pricing model). Other programs might pay more. I wouldn’t have been able to use the credentials if I hadn’t discovered the /adminer endpoint. That’s why fuzzing and content discovery are very important. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my blog.

According to Portswigger, A Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain.

When I give arbitary Origin, the application does not respond to those header requests. So, I have decided to use this CORScanner tool to check for any CORS Misconfigurations and found the following trust_any_suborigin vulnerability. {'url': 'https://www.redacted.com', 'type': 'trust_any_suborigin', 'credentials': 'true', 'origin': 'https://redacted.com', 'status_code': 200} This is a risky trust dependency, because if there is a vulnerable subdomain and an attacker takes control of the subdomain, then he might able to host his payload scripts and extract the sensitive Information from the parent domain through this CORS vulnerability. So I checked once again manually in burp to make sure this Trust any subdomain is true. As expected, I got the following result and I could able to see that injected subdomain is getting reflected in the response. GET /sensitive-victim-data HTTP/1.1 Host: redacted.com Origin: https://redacted.com Cookie: sessionid=...

But unfortunately the VO rejected with the below comment: VO First Message Now I need to find the a vulnerable subdomain, since they need an evidence that there is existing subdomain vulnerability and as per the scope the subdomain-takeover is considered as out of scope. Therefore, I need to find atleast there is a vulnerable subdomain available to strengthen my evidence to prove that this attack could be lethal and potential attack vector to get my payout. So, I have started to look for any subdomain-takeover vulnerabilities on the target, I used the tool subfinder to collect all the subdomain from the target and then passed the output to Subjack to check any dns misconfigurations. Luckily, I found a subdomain on Microsoft Azure, the Azure endpoint has been removed, but the DNS information has not been updated. The status of the request has changed from “NOERROR” to “NXDOMAIN” because the actual endpoint (and the IP addresses associated to it) no longer exists, but from the adversary’s perspective the alias “user.redacted.com is still configured. This was similar to this writeup from Synack-CloudSubdomain-Takeover and this article gave me the steps for performing Azure-Subdomain Takeover. But all I needed was the dig command which gave me the output NXDOMAIN to prove that there exists a subdomain vulnerability. Also I created a below PoC code to show that, If an attacker takeover that subdomain and then chain it with CORS, he could retrieve the sensitive Informations from the application. \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003ctitle\u003eSubdomain-Based CORS POC\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003eSubdomain-Based CORS POC\u003c/h\u003e \u003cscript\u003e var crossoriginget = new XMLHttpRequest(); //The target site with the bad CORS configuration var url = 'https://redacted.com/portal/account/info?customerNumber=100'; crossoriginget.open('GET',","date":"2023-01-23","objectID":"/posts/tale-of-2/:0:2","tags":["infosec","bugbounty","synack","cors"],"title":"Chaining the tale of 2 Vulnerabilities","uri":"/posts/tale-of-2/"},{"categories":["Infosec","Bugbounty","Synack"],"content":"Further Recommended Reading Can I Takeover XYZ https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz/issues/35 Subdomain Takeover Protips https://securitytrails.com/blog/subdomain-takeover-tips Subdomain Takeover https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/10-Test_for_Subdomain_Takeover ","date":"2023-01-23","objectID":"/posts/tale-of-2/:0:3","tags":["infosec","bugbounty","synack","cors"],"title":"Chaining the tale of 2 Vulnerabilities","uri":"/posts/tale-of-2/"},{"categories":["Infosec","Fileupload","php"],"content":"This blog contains the Information about the php file upload bypass and the role of .htaccess file in this bypass.

My journey with Synack started in October 2021, but I have only started to get more hands-on since February 2022. Within the span of next 10 months, I was managed to reach the Level 5 in Synack and won 15of15 award twice in my Level-1 and in my Level-3. Due to my performance, I was inducted to Synack Acropolis within 4-5 months. I mainly hunt on synack since their payout is quite fast and very responsive customer support. Synack-Acropolis The first few weeks in synack was completely new, Since it is a private bug bounty program and I had to learn lots of new procedures which they incorporated and had to follow it. Since everything was properly documented in their help-guide. This helped me alot to understand and their customer support and the community people on Slack channel were really helpful and quite fast. Synack only accept Impactful findings as a valid one. So for ex: findings like Security headers , Cookie Flags, TLS/SSL misconfigurations won’t be accepted, unless you show an Impact on it. For ex: phpinfo() output won’t be accepted as sensitive Information exposure until you show an Account Takeover possibility using that exposure. This gives me a new dimension and to always look for more Impactful finding during my every assessment. Not only that, they also thrives in report quality. This helped me alot to improve at my current work as well. After few weeks, I understood the process and expectation from synack and then I have started to find bugs and started to make a good report as well. This helped me to improve my report-writing skills as well. I won the first month 15of15 award for Level-1 in synack and same during septemeber 2022 for the Level-3 as well. Synack-15of15 Then, I have started to find more bugs on the platform on the regular basis. I have reported 54 vulnerabilities last year in below categories mentioned in the bar diagram. Majority of the vulnerabilities are from the categories Cross-Site Scripting and Access Control/IDORs Overview of my Accepted Findings Category 2022 I have received the coins for each level from synack as a token of appreciation along with their first-vulnerabiliy swag, which they give to SRT for finding their first vulnerability on the platform.

These experience gave me indepth analysis in web application penetration testing field. Also, I did alot of HacktheBox and TryHackMe rooms in the last 2-3 years as well. I felt I was missing alot in Windows Active Directory part and the recent change in OSCP which included Active Directory as 40 points machine. It is undoubtedly the integral part in clearing the OSCP exam. With this in mind along with my recent work, I was able to focus mainly working many Internal Active Directory assessments as well. I gained ample amount of experience in the past 1.6 years. To extend this knowledge, I regiserted for the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) course in Pentester Academy which helped me to get more deep understanding on Windows Active Directory environment.

I did almost 71 machines from the labs. It had 75 overall machines If I remember correct. Some machines in the lab were quite straight forward and few were really challenging. I went to Burp Suite Web Academy and completed the SQL-Injection lessons and Buffer Overflow room in TryHackMe as well.

This was one of the best decisions which helped me in clearing the exam as well. I have decided to take a month subscription from Proving Grounds Practice since it is directly from Offensive Security and there were many retired machines available as well. I decided to complete the famous TJ-Null OSCP-Like-Machines from Proving Grounds. I ended up finishing all the Windows machines and medium machines on Linux along with TJ-Null recommended machines. These machines were really tougher than the machines present in OSCP labs and this teached me so many techniques in the area of web application, privilege-escalation areas.
